# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition System using Python, OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that uses a webcam to track hand landmarks, recognize gestures like “Pointer”, “Stop”, and “Move”, and allows finger-based drawing on the screen with auto-disappearing text. It detects both left and right hands, displays gesture name and hand type, and shows live FPS.
